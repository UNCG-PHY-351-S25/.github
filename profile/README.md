## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

This GitHub organization ("org") is for students taking the Spring 2025 instantiation of PHY 351 (*Intro to Computational Physics*) at UNCG.

If you're a student in the course and you're seeing this, one of five things is true:

1. you're not currently logged into GitHub;
2. you haven't yet been invited to join the org;
3. you haven't yet accepted the invitation with your GitHub account;
4. you've got "View as: Public" chosen instead of "View as: Member" over at the right of this page; or
5. something unexpected has gone haywire.

What should you do about these?

1. Log into GitHub (with an account using your UNCG username as the GitHub username and linked to your UNCG email address);
2. Ask Prof. Beatty to send you an invite.
3. Click on your profile icon at the top right of this page, click "Your organizations", and look at the resulting list for an org with "Accept" and "Decline" buttons. Obviously, click "Accept".
4. Check that Public/Member toggle.
5. Talk to Prof. Beatty.

See you in the private area!
