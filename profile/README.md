## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

This GitHub organization ("org") is for students taking the Spring 2025 instantiation of PHY 351 (*Intro to Computational Physics*) at UNCG.

If you're a student in the course and you're seeing this, one of four things is true:

1. you haven't yet been invited to join the org;
2. you've been invited but haven't yet accepted the invitation with your GitHub account;
3. you've been invited and you've accepted, but you've got "View as: Public" chosen instead of "View as: Member" over at the right of this page; or
4. something unexpected has gone haywire.

What should you do about these?

1. If you haven't yet been invited, ask Prof. Beatty to send you an invite.
2. If he says you've been invited, click on your profile icon at the top right of this page, click "Your organizations", and look at the resulting list for an org with "Accept" and "Decline" buttons. Obviously, click "Accept".
3. If you're a member, check that Public/Member toggle.
4. If none of that works, talk to Prof. Beatty.

See you in the private area!
